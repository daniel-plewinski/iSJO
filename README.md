**iSJO** - Language School Management System
========================================

This is my final project created during a programming bootcamp. It shows my PHP coding skills and the ability to use the Symfony 3 with Doctrine ORM databases. 

As the project had been developed at the earlier stages of my programming education, I would use different technologies now, including a modern JS framework (such as Angular) for the frontend.

> **Note:**
> - The GUI of this service is in Polish 

The project can be tested [here](http://isjo.codereborn.pl)
